I have specialized and core expertise to work in web and mobile applications in a variety of industries, ranging from startups to enterprises.
I got my start working as a developer to work . Since then, I have progressed to building and working with large, highly-customized and integrated 
platforms, becoming an expert in full-stack development. I have also had the opportunity to work extensively with many other frameworks and API's. 
I excel at meeting goals, making deadlines and consistently challenging myself to learn new things. I am both detail and goal oriented and thrive in 
a fast-paced environment.
